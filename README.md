# Hackathon Project: Ensuring Reliable Global Access to Wave Prediction Data

## Background
Beaches worldwide attract millions of visitors annually, ranging from surfers seeking optimal wave conditions to families prioritizing safe swimming environments. To serve these diverse needs, a web-based platform was developed to provide daily wave size predictions. This critical tool helps users make informed decisions about beach activities, balancing adventure seekers' desires with family safety requirements.

## The Challenge
Our wave prediction platform faces critical operational challenges that hinder its reliability and global accessibility:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Issues:**
- **Service Reliability**
  - Frequent server downtime disrupting real-time data access
  - Performance bottlenecks during peak usage hours
  - 43% increase in outage-related complaints YoY

- **Global Accessibility**
  - Latency issues for international users
  - Inconsistent performance across geographical regions
  - Limited language/localization support

- **Infrastructure Challenges**
  - 78% higher-than-industry-average maintenance costs
  - Vertical scaling limitations during surge periods
  - Lack of automated failover mechanisms

- **Security Risks**
  - Multiple vulnerability reports in past 6 months
  - Insufficient DDoS protection measures
  - GDPR compliance gaps for European users

## Hackathon Objectives
Develop an innovative solution that addresses these critical requirements:

üéØ **Primary Goals**
1. Achieve 99.99% uptime guarantee
2. Support 10x user capacity scaling during peak periods
3. Reduce latency to <200ms for global users
4. Cut infrastructure costs by 40%
5. Implement enterprise-grade security measures

üõ† **Technical Requirements**
- Multi-cloud/edge computing strategies
- Automated scaling solutions
- Global CDN implementation
- Cost-optimized architecture
- Robust security framework (OWASP Top 10 compliance)

5. **Security Implementation**  
   (Threat mitigation, compliance, encryption)

6. **Innovation Factor**  
   (Novel approaches to distributed systems)

## Submission Requirements
Teams must provide:

1. **Solution Overview**  
   Technical white paper (max 5 pages)

2. **Architecture Diagram**  
   Visual representation of proposed infrastructure

3. **Implementation Roadmap**  
   6-month deployment plan with milestones

4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
